# Printerest like floating Tab Bar
> During the quarantine I challenged myself to pick out some designs on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and then try to implement them in Swift to keep myself busy. I did not set myself any requirements in quality or anything like that. The only thing is that I have to be able to implement it in a day or less (depending on how much time I have). Status will then be pushed to GitHub without further ado. Projects may or may not be developed further later.

- Number 1: [Simple TabBar Onboarding](https://github.com/chrishoste/simpleTabBarOnboarding)
- Number 2: You're here 😅

## Design
After some exploring this time on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.de/) I decided to go for their own `Tab-Bar`-Implementation. 

🏙: Coming soon

## My final implementation

As in my [first challenge](https://github.com/chrishoste/simpleTabBarOnboarding), I have tried to approach the original implementation as closely as possible.

🎥: Coming soon

## Features

- [x] Uses `UITabBarController` (I'm only hiding the TabBar & triggering the items programmatically).
- [x] Adapts dynamically to the number of items.
- [x] `outline` & `filled`icons dependig on the state.
- [x] First Item is `Red`in selected state, like the original implementation.
- [ ] When scrolling the TabBar disappears.

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 11

## Usage

Feel free to use anything you want or need.
