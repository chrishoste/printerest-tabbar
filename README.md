# Printerest `like` floating Tab Bar

> This was created during my [quarantine challenges](https://github.com/chrishoste/quarantine-challenge). Check out the more stuff I did during this time.

## Design
After some exploring this time on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.de/) I decided to go for their own `Tab-Bar`-Implementation.

## My final implementation

As in my [first challenge](https://github.com/chrishoste/simpleTabBarOnboarding), I have tried to approach the original implementation as closely as possible.

## Features

- [x] Uses `UITabBarController` (I'm only hiding the TabBar & triggering the items programmatically).
- [x] Adapts dynamically to the number of items.
- [x] `outline` & `filled`icons dependig on the state.
- [x] First Item is `Red`in selected state, like the original implementation.
- [x] Small pulse animation on tap.
- [ ] When scrolling the TabBar disappears.

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 11

## Usage

Feel free to use anything you want or need.
